# Eml-Viewer

On that project I worked on parsing eml files:
1. Display in a tree view all the parts of the eml.
2. Disply the header of each part.
3. Disaply the raw content of each part.
4. If decodable, display the content of the part in human readable text.
5. If part is of image type, displays the image.
